This is the wire that carries current from the power source to the load. It's essential to be aware of this when handling such wires to avoid electrical shock.",
        "Electrical safety is a primary concern for any amateur radio operator. It's important to know how to handle electricity safely to prevent any accidents or fires. In a four-conductor 240 VAC circuit, only the **hot wires** should be attached to fuses or circuit breakers. This helps protect the circuit from overloading and causing a potential fire.",

When the duty cycle changes from 100 percent to 50 percent, the allowable power density for RF safety increases by a factor of 2.
