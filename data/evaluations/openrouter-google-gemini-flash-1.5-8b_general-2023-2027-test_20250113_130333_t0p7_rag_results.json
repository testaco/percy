Intermodulation can create interference between two repeaters in close proximity when the output signals mix in the final amplifier of one or both transmitters.",
        "When two signals are mixed in a non-linear circuit, they can produce unwanted spurious outputs, a phenomenon known as **intermodulation**. The intermodulation products can be even- or odd-order, depending on the frequencies involved. An example of an odd-order intermodulation product of frequencies F1 and F2 is 3F1-F2. Such distortions can degrade the performance of a communication system by causing interference and reducing signal clarity."

        "To prevent standing waves on a feed line connected to an antenna, the antenna feed point impedance must be matched to the characteristic impedance of the feed line. This allows for maximum power transfer and minimum reflection.",
        "However, if the impedance of the antenna and the feed line do not match, some power will be reflected back towards the transmitter, creating standing waves along the feed line. This is reflected as an SWR reading greater than 1:1, indicating an impedance mismatch. For instance, an SWR reading of 4:1 indicates a significant impedance mismatch.",

We will unravel the factors that determine the characteristic impedance of a parallel conductor feed line, the relationship between high SWR and transmission line loss, and the nominal characteristic impedance of \u201cwindow line\u201d transmission line. We will also explore what causes reflected power at an antenna\u2019s feed point, how the attenuation of coaxial cable changes with increasing frequency, and in what units RF feed line loss is usually expressed."

        "The performance of a Yagi antenna can be adjusted by changing the physical length of the boom, the number of elements on the boom, or the spacing of each element along the boom. These adjustments can optimize the antenna's forward gain, front-to-back ratio, or standing wave ratio (SWR) bandwidth.",
        "There are several performance metrics to consider when it comes to Yagi antennas. The first of these is **antenna gain**, which measures the antenna's ability to direct energy in a specific direction compared to an isotropic antenna, which radiates equally in all directions. Gain is often expressed in two ways: dBi and dBd. The gain in **dBi** refers to the gain compared to an ideal isotropic antenna, while the gain in **dBd** is the gain compared to a half-wave dipole. The gain in dBi is always **2.15 dB higher** than the gain in dBd for the same antenna.",
        "An interesting aspect of Yagi antennas is that their gain can be increased by stacking multiple antennas. For instance, the gain of two three-element, horizontally polarized Yagi antennas spaced vertically half a wavelength apart in free space is typically about **3 dB higher** than the gain of a single three-element Yagi."

This antenna design takes advantage of the ionospheric refraction to send signals almost straight up, allowing them to fall back to Earth over a wide area.",

This allows for effective short distance communication on the MF and HF bands at high elevation angles, as the signals cover an area in a near-perfect circle around the transmitting station, reaching areas that would otherwise be in the station's skip zone.",
