# Mastering Digital Modes and Procedures for VHF and UHF

In this section, we will delve into the world of digital modes and procedures that are used in the VHF and UHF bands. We will explore various digital modes such as JT65, FT8, and FT4, and their applications in different scenarios like meteor scatter and EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) communications. We will also discuss tracking technologies and digital protocols used in amateur radio.

## Meteor Scatter Communications and EME 

Meteor scatter communication employs a unique phenomenon where signals are bounced off the ionized trails of meteors entering the earth's atmosphere. This mode of communication is often used when traditional paths of propagation are not available. **MSK144** is a digital mode explicitly designed for meteor scatter communications. It is a fast mode that allows contacts to be made with brief signals from burning meteors.

Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) communications, also known as moonbounce, is another fascinating area of amateur radio. In this method, radio signals are directed towards the moon and reflected back to Earth. The digital mode designed for EME communications is **Q65**. This mode has excellent performance under weak signal conditions and is particularly well suited for EME communications.

## APRS: Automatic Packet Reporting System

The Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is a digital communication system used to transmit real-time data, information, and reports over an amateur radio network. The APRS network uses **AX.25** as its digital protocol, which is a network protocol originally designed for packet radio systems. 

Information transmitted over APRS is usually in the form of packets. APRS beacon data is typically transmitted using an **Unnumbered Information** (UI) packet frame. 

APRS is also used for real-time tracking of objects, such as weather balloons carrying amateur radio transmitters. This is done using a combination of GPS and amateur radio signals.

## Understanding JT65 and FT Modes

**JT65** is a digital mode that uses multi-tone frequency shift keying. It's known for its ability to decode signals with a very low signal-to-noise ratio, making it effective for weak signal communications. 

When using the **FT8** or **FT4** modes in a VHF contest, the information that replaces the signal-to-noise ratio is the **Grid Square**. The grid square is a shorthand method for describing your general location anywhere on the Earth's surface.

## Packet Paths and Data Relay in APRS

In APRS, the packet path describes the route that a packet will take through the network. For instance, **WIDE3-1** designates that three digipeater hops are requested with one remaining.

APRS stations relay data using **packet digipeaters**. A digipeater is a device that receives a packet of digital information and retransmits it, extending the range of the original signal. It's an essential component of the APRS network, helping to ensure that information is spread over a wide area. 

## Wrapping Up

Understanding these digital modes and procedures used in VHF and UHF bands can enhance your versatility as an amateur radio operator. Whether you're communicating via meteor scatter, tracking a high-altitude balloon, or participating in a VHF contest, these digital modes open up a world of possibilities.
