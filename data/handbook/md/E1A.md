# Mastering Frequency Privileges and Restrictions in Amateur Radio

Understanding the nuances of frequency privileges, bandwidth allocations, power restrictions, and operational regulations in specific contexts, such as aboard vessels or aircraft, is crucial in amateur radio. This section will help you grasp these aspects, ensuring that you comply with FCC regulations while enjoying the full potential of your Extra Class license.

## Understanding Bandwidth and Frequency

In amateur radio, the term **bandwidth** refers to the range of frequencies occupied by a signal. It's essential to ensure that your signal fits within the bandwidth allocated to the amateur radio band you are using. The **carrier frequency** is the central frequency of a signal, and it has a significant role in determining whether the signal fits within the allocated bandwidth.

For instance, when using a transceiver that displays the carrier frequency of phone signals, you need to account for the bandwidth of the signal to ensure the entire signal is within the band. In the case of a Lower Side Band (LSB) signal, the displayed carrier frequency is the highest frequency of the signal, so it must be adjusted to ensure the lower frequencies of the signal fit within the band. Conversely, for an Upper Side Band (USB) signal, the carrier frequency is the lowest frequency, so you must ensure that the upper frequencies of the signal do not exceed the band limits.

## Navigating Frequency Privileges on Different Bands

Different amateur bands have different frequency privileges. For example, the 20-meter band is an amateur radio band spanning from 14.000 MHz to 14.350 MHz. The highest legal carrier frequency for transmitting a signal on this band would depend on the width of the signal. If you're transmitting a 2.8 kHz wide USB data signal, you must ensure that the upper frequencies of the signal (which extend above the carrier frequency) do not exceed 14.350 MHz.

On the 60-meter band, however, channelized operation is used. In this case, the required transmit frequency of a Continuous Wave (CW) signal is at the center frequency of the channel, ensuring that the signal fits within the channel.

## Power Restrictions on Specific Bands

Certain bands have specific power restrictions. For example, on the 2200-meter and 630-meter bands, the maximum power permitted is 1 watt EIRP and 5 watts EIRP respectively (except in some parts of Alaska for the 630-meter band).

## Operating Amateur Radio on Ships and Aircraft

Operating an amateur radio station aboard a vessel or aircraft comes with specific requirements. The station must be under the physical control of a person holding an FCC-issued amateur license or who is authorized for alien reciprocal operation. Before operating the station, its operation must be approved by the master of the ship or the pilot in command of the aircraft. If the vessel is in international waters, any FCC-issued amateur license is sufficient.

## Adhering to Rules in Automatic Message Forwarding

Automatic message forwarding systems can be a great tool in amateur radio, but they also come with responsibilities. If a station in a message forwarding system inadvertently forwards a message that is in violation of FCC rules, the control operator of the originating station is primarily accountable for the rules violation. This underscores the importance of ensuring that all communications adhere to FCC rules, even when using automated systems.
