# Operating Rules for Amateur Radio Stations

## Complying with FCC Inspections

As an amateur radio operator, it's crucial to understand that your station and its records must be readily available for inspection by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This means that an FCC representative can request to inspect your station and all related records at any given time. Keeping your station records well-organized and easily accessible not only makes this process smoother but also demonstrates your commitment to adhering to FCC regulations.

## Station Identification

While operating, you are required to transmit your assigned **call sign**. This is a unique identifier assigned by the FCC which serves to identify your station during communications. Your call sign must be transmitted at least every 10 minutes during a communication and at the end of your communication. This ensures that the identity of your station is clear to all other operators involved in the communication.

For those who may be using **tactical call signs**, such as "Race Headquarters", you are still required to identify your station with your FCC-assigned call sign at the end of each communication and every ten minutes during a communication. 

When it comes to language, the identification must be performed in the English language if you are operating in a phone sub-band. This ensures that your identification is universally understood as English is the standard language used in international telecommunications. 

For a station transmitting **phone signals**, the call sign identification must be sent using either a continuous wave (CW) or phone emission. You can also use self-assigned indicators, such as "KL7CC/W3", when using a phone transmission. 

## Third-Party Communications

A unique aspect of amateur radio operation is the allowance for **third-party communications**. This refers to the transmission of a message from a control operator to another amateur station control operator on behalf of another person. 

There are specific rules that apply when a non-licensed person is allowed to speak to a foreign station using a station under the control of a licensed amateur operator. One key restriction is that the foreign station must be in a country with which the U.S. has a third party agreement. Furthermore, the licensed control operator must be responsible for the station identification during this type of communication.

## Repeaters and Accountability

A **repeater station** is a type of amateur station that simultaneously retransmits the signal of another amateur station on a different channel or channels. This is typically done to extend the communication range, especially in areas with physical obstacles that could hinder direct communication.

When it comes to accountability, if a repeater inadvertently retransmits communications that violate the FCC rules, both the control operator of the originating station and the repeater owner bear the responsibility. This underscores the importance of ensuring that all communications adhere to FCC guidelines.

## Club Stations

Amateur radio is not only an individual pursuit but can also be a collective activity. Many operators join together to form radio clubs, which can obtain a **club station license grant**. The FCC issues these licenses to allow clubs to have a station operating under a club call sign. The requirement for issuance includes having at least four members in the club. The license grant is given to a trustee, who is responsible for the operation of the radio station under the club call sign.
