# Troubleshooting Common Transmitter and Receiver Problems
In this chapter, we delve into the realm of troubleshooting common transmitter and receiver problems. This includes understanding what causes these problems and possible remedies to rectify them. We will discuss issues such as over-deviation, fundamental overload, and distortion, among others. We will also touch on how to address RF interference issues with consumer electronics and how to reduce or eliminate such problems.

## Over-deviating Transmitters
In the world of amateur radio, you might come across the term *over-deviation*. This refers to a situation where the frequency deviation — the difference between the lowest and highest frequency in an FM signal — is too high. Over-deviation can cause your transmissions to spill over into adjacent frequencies, leading to potential interference with others on those frequencies.

If you're using an FM handheld or mobile transceiver and are informed that you're over-deviating, the best solution is to adjust your speech volume. You should aim to speak more quietly and hold the microphone further away from your mouth. This will reduce the deviation of your signal, preventing it from spilling over into adjacent frequencies.

## Unintentional Reception of Amateur Radio Transmissions
Sometimes, a broadcast AM or FM radio might unintentionally pick up an amateur radio transmission. This typically happens when the receiver is unable to reject strong signals outside of the AM or FM band it's designed to receive. The technical term for this is *fundamental overload*, which simply means the receiver is being overwhelmed by a signal that is too strong.

To counteract this, you can use a filter at the antenna input of the affected receiver. The filter will block the amateur signal, thus reducing or eliminating the fundamental overload. 

## Radio Frequency Interference
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a common issue in amateur radio. It can be caused by several factors such as *fundamental overload*, *harmonics* (signals at multiples of the original frequency), and *spurious emissions* (unwanted signals). 

When you encounter RFI, the first step is to ensure that your station is functioning correctly and not causing interference to your own radio or television. If the problem persists, you might want to consider working with your neighbor to identify the offending device. You can then take measures to eliminate the interference, ensuring your station meets the standards of good amateur practice.

## Distorted Audio and RF Feedback
Another common problem in amateur radio is distorted audio, often caused by RF current on the shield of a microphone cable. This is known as *RF feedback*. Symptoms of RF feedback include garbled, distorted, or unintelligible voice transmissions.

A possible remedy for this problem is to use a *ferrite choke*. This device suppresses high frequency noise, preventing it from reaching the microphone and causing distortion. 

## Dealing with Interference from a Nearby Station
If you're experiencing overload on your VHF transceiver due to a nearby commercial FM station, you could consider installing a *band-reject filter*. This device rejects signals at a specific frequency, reducing the impact of the nearby station's signal.

## Non-Fiber Optic Cable TV Interference
If your amateur radio transmission is causing interference to non-fiber optic cable TV, you should first ensure all TV feed line coaxial connectors are installed properly. If the interference persists, you can add a low-pass filter to the TV antenna input. This filter allows signals with frequencies lower than a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while blocking higher frequency signals.

## Unintelligible Signal through an FM Repeater
If you receive a report that your audio signal through an FM repeater is distorted or unintelligible, several factors could be at play. It could be that your transmitter is slightly off frequency, or your batteries are running low. Additionally, your location could also cause poor signal quality. In such cases, check your transmitter's frequency, replace your batteries if they're low, and consider relocating to a better location to improve your signal.
