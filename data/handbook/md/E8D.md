# Embracing the Nuances of Digital Signals and Spread Spectrum

In this section, we'll delve into the fascinating world of digital signals and spread spectrum communications, exploring their unique characteristics and the precautions necessary to ensure their effective use. We'll also touch upon digital codes, their advantages, and how they differ from each other.

## Spread Spectrum: A Shield Against Interference

One of the most intriguing aspects of spread spectrum communication is its remarkable resistance to interference. This resilience is attributable to the unique way in which spread spectrum systems operate. When a spread spectrum signal is received, signals not employing the spread spectrum algorithm are suppressed. In other words, the receiver is tuned specifically to acknowledge spread spectrum signals, effectively ignoring potential interference from other sources.

## Techniques in Spread Spectrum Communication

There are several techniques associated with spread spectrum communication. Two key methods are **Direct sequence** and **Frequency hopping**.

**Direct sequence** employs a high-speed binary bit stream to shift the phase of an RF carrier. This method spreads the signal over a wide frequency band. The receiver must know the spreading code to correctly interpret the received signal.

**Frequency hopping**, on the other hand, involves rapidly varying the frequency of a transmitted signal according to a pseudorandom sequence. This sequence is known both by the transmitter and the receiver, allowing the receiver to 'hop' frequencies in sync with the transmitter, effectively following the transmitted signal across the frequency spectrum.

## Key Clicks: The Unwanted Effects of Short Rise or Fall Times

In Morse code transmissions, or Continuous Wave (CW) operation, the rise and fall times of a signal refer to how quickly the signal reaches its peak power (rise) and drops back to zero (fall). Extremely short rise or fall times can lead to the generation of **key clicks**, which are unwanted signal artefacts that can cause interference to nearby frequencies.

To avoid key clicks, it's important to moderate the rise and fall times of the keying waveform. This is typically achieved by making the rise and fall times smoother, thus preventing the abrupt changes that cause key clicks.

## ASCII and Parity Bits: A Measure Against Errors

ASCII, or American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a commonly used digital code in data communications. An interesting feature of ASCII is the inclusion of **parity bits**. These are extra bits added to the ASCII characters to enable the detection of some types of errors. By comparing the parity bit with the data, the system can identify if an error has occurred during transmission, thus enhancing the reliability of the communication.

## Overmodulation and Intermodulation Distortion in AFSK

In Audio Frequency Shift Keying (AFSK), overmodulation is often caused by excessive transmit audio levels. Overmodulation can lead to distortion in the received signal, reducing the quality of the communication.

This distortion can be evaluated using the Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) parameter. IMD is a measure of the unwanted signals produced due to the non-linear behavior of a system when subjected to multiple frequency inputs. In an idling PSK (Phase Shift Keying) signal, an IMD level of -30 dB is generally considered acceptable.

## Comparing Baudot and ASCII Codes

Baudot and ASCII are two digital codes commonly used in data communications, each with its unique features.

Baudot uses 5 data bits per character and employs 2 characters as letters/figures shift codes. ASCII, on the other hand, uses 7 or 8 data bits per character and does not require a letters/figures shift code.

One advantage of ASCII over Baudot is its ability to transmit both uppercase and lowercase text, making it a more flexible choice for data communications.
