# Mastering HF Mobile and Portable Stations: From Antennas to Alternative Energy Sources

Amateur radio isn't just about communicating from the comfort of your home station. Often, operators find themselves operating on the go, whether it's from a car, a camping site, or during emergency situations. In this section, we'll explore the ins and outs of HF mobile and portable stations, from understanding mobile antenna modifications and power connections to managing potential interferences and incorporating alternative energy sources like solar panels.

## Mobile Antenna Modifications: Capacitance Hat and Corona Ball

When it comes to mobile antennas, especially those used for HF communication, certain modifications can make a significant difference in performance. Two such modifications are the **capacitance hat** and the **corona ball**.

A **capacitance hat** is a device added to a mobile antenna to electrically lengthen a physically short antenna. In other words, it makes the antenna behave as if it's longer than it physically is. This can greatly improve the antenna's efficiency, particularly on lower frequency bands.

On the other hand, a **corona ball** serves a different purpose. It's a spherical component attached to the tip of an HF mobile antenna. Its function is to reduce RF voltage discharges from the antenna's tip while transmitting. This helps in reducing the chance of damage if the antenna should strike an object, as well as protecting the antenna from weather-related damage like lightning strikes.

## Powering Your HF Mobile Installation

To run an HF mobile installation, particularly one operating at 100 watts, you'll need a reliable and robust power source. The best option is to make a direct, fused power connection to the battery using heavy-gauge wire. This ensures a steady supply of power and reduces the risk of voltage drops or electrical noise which could interfere with your transceiver's performance.

Avoid supplying DC power for your 100-watt HF transceiver from a vehicle's auxiliary power socket. The socket's wiring is often inadequate for the current drawn by the transceiver, which could lead to overheating or even damage to the vehicleâ€™s electrical system.

## Efficiency and Interference in HF Mobile Installations

A key challenge in HF mobile installations is ensuring the efficiency of the electrically short antenna. Shortened mobile antennas, while convenient for mobile operations, often have limited operating bandwidths. They can also be less efficient than their full-sized counterparts.

Another concern is interference. The battery charging system, the fuel delivery system, and the vehicle's control computers can all potentially cause receive interference to an HF transceiver installed in a vehicle. Thus, it's crucial to plan your mobile installation carefully to minimize these interference sources.

## Harnessing the Power of the Sun: Solar Panels for HF Mobile Stations

Solar panels offer an excellent alternative energy source for HF mobile and portable stations. They provide a renewable, clean, and often free source of electricity, making them ideal for long-term operations or in areas where traditional power sources aren't readily available.

Solar panels are made up of individual cells, which are connected together in a series-parallel configuration. A fully illuminated silicon photovoltaic cell generates an approximate open-circuit voltage of 0.5 VDC.

When connecting a solar panel to a storage battery, it's essential to include a series diode. This prevents the discharge of the battery through the panel during times of low or no illumination.

If you're connecting a solar panel to a lithium iron phosphate battery, make sure that the solar panel has a charge controller. This device regulates the voltage and current coming from the solar panels and ensures that the battery isn't overcharged, which could lead to damage or even a safety hazard.
