# Commanding the Cosmos: Amateur Space and Earth Stations

## Telemetry and Telecommand

In the world of amateur radio, the term **telemetry** refers to the one-way transmission of measurements from a measuring instrument situated at a distance. For example, a weather balloon equipped with a temperature sensor might send back telemetry data to a ground station, providing real-time updates on atmospheric conditions as the balloon ascends.

**Telecommand** is another crucial concept in this field. It involves one-way transmissions that initiate, modify, or terminate the functions of a device at a distance. This is the technology that allows us to control satellites and other remote equipment such as drones, rovers, or even model aircraft from a distance. 

An amateur station that transmits these telecommand signals is known as a **space telecommand station**. Please note that in certain cases, these telecommand signals may be encrypted for security reasons. 

## Identification and Regulation

When operating a **balloon-borne telemetry station**, there are specific identification requirements. The station's call sign must be included in the transmissions. This ensures that the source of the transmission can be identified, which is crucial for maintaining orderly and responsible use of the radio spectrum.

If a station is being operated by telecommand on or within 50 kilometers of the Earthâ€™s surface, a label with the name, address, and telephone number of the station licensee and the control operator must be posted at the location. This is to ensure that the operator can be contacted if there are any issues with the station.

When operating a model craft by telecommand, there are also power restrictions to consider. The maximum permitted transmitter output power is 1 watt. This limit helps to prevent interference with other users of the spectrum.

## Frequency Allocations for Space Stations

Amateur radio space stations have specific frequency allocations across the HF, VHF, and UHF amateur bands. On the HF band, amateur space stations have allocations on the 40 meters, 20 meters, 15 meters, and 10 meters bands. 

On the VHF band, frequencies authorized for space stations are found on the 2 meters band. For the UHF band, frequencies authorized for space stations are found on the 70 centimeters band.

## Who Can Operate as Earth Stations and Telecommand Stations?

The ability to operate as Earth stations or telecommand stations of space stations is subject to the privileges of the class of operator license held by the control operator of the station. This means that any amateur station can operate as an Earth station or a telecommand station, provided the control operator holds the appropriate license. 

## One-Way Communications

In some circumstances, amateur stations are permitted to transmit one-way communications. This is often the case for space stations, beacon stations, and telecommand stations. These types of stations often send out signals that are intended to be received but not necessarily responded to, such as beacon signals or telemetry data.
