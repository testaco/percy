# Shielding Your Radio: Understanding RF Interference and Grounding

## Battling RF Interference

In the world of amateur radio, **RF interference** is an unwanted disruption that can affect the audio frequency circuits of your radio. To reduce this interference, a **bypass capacitor** can be used. 

Interference can sometimes cover a wide range of frequencies. One common cause of this is **arcing** at a poor electrical connection. Arcing is an electrical breakdown of a gas that produces an ongoing plasma discharge, resulting from a current through normally nonconductive media such as air.

How RF interference manifests itself in an audio device can vary depending on the type of transmitter. For instance, if the interference is from a single sideband phone transmitter, you might hear **distorted speech**. In contrast, if the interference is from a CW transmitter, you might hear a **CW signal at a nearly pure audio frequency**.

## Grounding and Bonding: Safety First

Amateur radio, like any electrical device, can pose certain safety hazards. One such hazard is the risk of **RF burns**, which can be caused by high voltages. This situation might arise if the **ground wire has high impedance** on a particular frequency. 

In some cases, if a ground connection is resonant, it can lead to **high RF voltages on the enclosures of station equipment**. A resonant ground connection is one that resonates at the frequency of the transmitted signal, potentially causing increased RF voltage.

When grounding your radio equipment, it's important to remember that **soldered joints should not be used in lightning protection ground connections**. In the event of a lightning strike, the heat generated could potentially destroy a soldered joint.

## Reducing RF Interference and Minimizing Ground Loops

There are several strategies to reduce RF interference caused by **common-mode current** on an audio cable. One effective method is to **place a ferrite choke on the cable**. Ferrite chokes are passive electronic components that suppress high-frequency noise in electronic circuits.

Ground loops can cause unwanted noise and interference in your radio setup. One approach to minimize the effects of ground loops is to **bond equipment enclosures together**. 

A symptom of a ground loop in your station's audio connections could be receiving reports of **hum** on your station's transmitted signal. 

## Ensuring a Safe Operating Environment

The goal of every amateur radio operator should be to minimize RF "hot spots" in their station. One key technique to achieve this is by **bonding all equipment enclosures together**.

Finally, safety must be a top priority in any amateur radio station. To this end, all metal enclosures of station equipment must be grounded. This measure **ensures that hazardous voltages cannot appear on the chassis**, providing a safer operating environment for you and your equipment.
