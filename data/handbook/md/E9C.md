# Mastering Wire Antennas and Their Radiation Patterns

Wire antennas, their configurations, and the subsequent radiation patterns they produce are an integral part of amateur radio. This chapter will explore these concepts, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of practical wire antennas.

## Understanding Radiation Patterns of Vertical Antennas

The radiation pattern of an antenna is critical, as it determines the directions in which the antenna transmits and receives signals. Radiation patterns can be altered by changing the configuration of the antenna.

Two 1/4-wavelength vertical antennas spaced 1/2-wavelength apart and fed 180 degrees out of phase produce a **cardioid radiation pattern**. This pattern is heart-shaped, with maximum radiation and reception occurring in one direction.

If two 1/4-wavelength vertical antennas are spaced 1/4-wavelength apart and fed 90 degrees out of phase, the resulting radiation pattern is a **figure-eight end-fire along the axis of the array**. This pattern has two lobes of maximum radiation, positioned along the axis of the antenna array.

On the other hand, if two 1/4-wavelength vertical antennas are spaced 1/2-wavelength apart and fed in phase, the radiation pattern becomes **a figure-eight end-fire along the axis of the array**. This pattern also has two lobes of maximum radiation, but they are aligned along the axis of the array.

## Long Wire Antennas and Radiation Patterns

An **unterminated long wire antenna** changes its radiation pattern as the wire length increases. As the wire length grows, additional lobes form, with the major lobes increasingly aligned with the axis of the antenna. This setup can help to focus the signal in specific directions.

## The Intricacies of Off-Center-Fed Dipole Antennas

An **off-center-fed dipole (OCFD)** is fed between the center and one end instead of at the midpoint. This unique configuration is used to create a similar feed point impedance on multiple bands, allowing the antenna to operate efficiently across a range of frequencies.

## The Role of a Terminating Resistor in Antennas

A terminating resistor can be added to a rhombic or long-wire antenna to change its radiation pattern from bidirectional to unidirectional. This change allows for more focused transmission and reception of signals.

## Delving into Folded Dipole Antennas

A **folded dipole antenna** is a half-wave dipole with an additional parallel wire connecting its two ends. This design helps to increase the antenna's bandwidth, allowing it to transmit and receive over a broader range of frequencies. The feed point impedance at the center of a two-wire half-wave folded dipole antenna is approximately 300 ohms.

## G5RV and Zepp Antennas

The **G5RV antenna** is a wire antenna center-fed through a specific length of open-wire line connected to a balun and a coaxial feed line. This design allows the antenna to operate efficiently across multiple bands.

A **Zepp antenna**, on the other hand, is an end-fed half-wavelength dipole. It was originally used for zeppelin aircraft and is known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

## The Effect of Ground on Radiation Patterns

The far-field elevation pattern of a vertically polarized antenna is affected by the type of ground over which it is mounted. For instance, when mounted over seawater versus soil, radiation at low angles increases. This is because seawater is a better conductor than soil, leading to a lower angle of radiation and potentially greater range.

## Extended Double Zepp Antenna

An **extended double Zepp antenna** is a center-fed 1.5-wavelength dipole antenna. It's known for its high gain and broad bandwidth, making it a popular choice for many amateur radio operators.

## Impact of Antenna Height and Ground Slope

The radiation pattern of a horizontally polarized antenna varies with its height above ground. As the height increases, the takeoff angle of the lowest elevation lobe decreases, resulting in a lower angle of radiation and potentially greater range.

When a horizontally-polarized antenna is mounted above a long slope, the main lobe takeoff angle decreases in the downhill direction compared to the same antenna mounted above flat ground. Understanding this can help guide the placement and orientation of antennas for optimal performance.
