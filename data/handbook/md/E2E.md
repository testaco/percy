# Diving into Digital Modes in HF Amateur Radio

In this section, we'll explore the fascinating world of digital modes in High Frequency (HF) amateur radio. From Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) to various digital protocols such as FT4, FST4, or WSJT-X, we'll delve into the way these modes work and how they differ from one another.

## Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

**Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)** is a digital modulation scheme typically used for data emissions below 30 MHz. In FSK, the frequency of the carrier signal varies in accordance with the digital signal changes. This method is commonly used in amateur radio digital modes due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## WSJT-X Digital Mode and Synchronization

WSJT-X is a popular software used by amateur radio operators to facilitate weak signal communication. One of its key features is the synchronization of computer clocks. This synchronization is critical for proper timing of transmit/receive cycles in digital modes.

## Understanding FT4 and FST4

FT4 is a digital mode that stands for "Franke-Taylor design, 4 FSK modulation". The "4" in FT4 refers to the four transmit/receive cycles per minute. This mode is designed for rapid-fire contest exchanges, and it's three times faster than its predecessor, FT8.

FST4, on the other hand, is another digital mode designed for use at very low signal-to-noise ratios on the LF and MF bands. FST4 uses four-tone Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying. This mode allows variable transmit/receive periods and seven different tone spacings, providing flexibility in adapting to varying propagation conditions.

## Varieties of Digital Modes

There's a vast array of digital modes available for amateur radio operators. Some, like RTTY, PSK31, and MFSK16, support keyboard-to-keyboard operation, allowing direct communication between operators. However, others like WSPR, the Weak Signal Propagation Reporter, do not support this feature. WSPR is primarily used for measuring radio propagation in low-power, beacon-like transmissions.

## The FT8 Transmission Cycle

FT8, another digital mode in the WSJT-X software suite, operates with a fixed-length transmission cycle of 15 seconds. This short cycle length makes it an excellent mode for making quick contacts, especially in challenging conditions.

## A Look at Q65 and JT65

Q65 and JT65 are both digital modes designed for minimal signal-to-noise ratio communication. Q65 differs from JT65 in several ways: it supports keyboard-to-keyboard operation, uses Quadrature Modulation, and averages multiple receive cycles.

## Binary File Transfer Using PACTOR

When it comes to transferring binary files in HF digital modes, PACTOR stands out. This mode combines elements of packet and AMTOR digital communications to provide error-free text transmission, making it suitable for sending files.

## Variable-Length Character Coding in PSK31

PSK31 is a digital mode that uses a unique feature: variable-length character coding. This method assigns shorter codes to more frequently used characters, making the communication more efficient.

## Narrow Bandwidth Digital Modes

Of the many digital modes available, FT8 boasts one of the narrowest bandwidths. Its compact signal makes it a popular choice for crowded bands and low-power (QRP) operation.

## Direct FSK vs. Audio FSK

In Direct Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), the transmitterâ€™s VFO (Variable Frequency Oscillator) is modulated. This is in contrast to Audio FSK, where an audio tone is used to modulate the carrier. This direct modulation method allows for the transmission of higher baud rates and occupies less bandwidth.

## Contact Establishment in ALE

Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) is a protocol used by HF radios to establish contact with each other. An ALE station constantly scans a list of frequencies, activating the radio when the designated call sign is received. This method allows for efficient and automated communication, especially in challenging conditions.

## High Data Throughput Digital Modes

For high data throughput under clear communication conditions, PACTOR IV stands out among digital modes. It is an evolution of the PACTOR series of digital communication modes and is designed to provide high-speed data transfer in various conditions.
