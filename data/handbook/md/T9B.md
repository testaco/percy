# Mastering the Basics of Feed Lines, Antennas, and Connectors

In this guide, we will delve into the world of **feed lines**, **antennas**, and **RF connectors**. We will explore the importance of low standing wave ratio (SWR), the common impedance of coaxial cables in amateur radio, and why coaxial cables are the most used feed lines. Additionally, we will discuss the function of an antenna tuner, the effects of frequency increase on signal in a coaxial cable, and the types of RF connectors suitable for frequencies above 400 MHz. We'll also touch on the sources of loss in a coaxial feed line and the differences between RG-58 and RG-213 coaxial cables. Lastly, we'll look into the types of feed lines that have the lowest loss at VHF and UHF, and define standing wave ratio (SWR).

## Understanding Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)

The **Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)** is a concept that is fundamental to understanding how effectively radio frequency power is transmitted from the antenna, and how well the antenna is matched to the transmission line. A low SWR indicates a good match, meaning more power reaches the antenna and less is reflected back to the transmitter, which helps prevent equipment damage. 

## Coaxial Cables: The Backbone of Amateur Radio

**Coaxial cables** are the most common type of feed line used in amateur radio antenna systems. The most common impedance for these cables is 50 ohms. They are popular because they are easy to use and require few special installation considerations, although they are not necessarily the least expensive or the lowest loss option available.

One key thing to remember is that as the frequency of a signal in a coaxial cable is increased, the loss also increases. This is due to the skin effect where the signal tends to travel more on the surface of the conductor at higher frequencies, resulting in increased resistance.

## The Role of an Antenna Tuner

An **antenna tuner**, also known as an antenna coupler, has a major function of matching the antenna system impedance to the transceiver's output impedance. This ensures that maximum power is transferred from the transceiver to the antenna.

## RF Connectors: Making the Right Choice

The selection of **RF connectors** is crucial in amateur radio operations. The type of connector suitable depends on the frequency. For frequencies above 400 MHz, Type N connectors are most suitable. The PL-259 type coax connectors are commonly used at HF and VHF frequencies.

## Understanding Coaxial Feed Line Loss

There are several sources of loss in a coaxial feed line. These include water intrusion into coaxial connectors, high SWR, and the use of multiple connectors in the line. It is important to maintain your equipment to prevent these types of losses. Erratic changes in SWR, for instance, could be caused by a loose connection in the antenna or feed line.

## RG-58 vs RG-213: What's the Difference?

When it comes to different types of coaxial cables, it's important to understand their specific characteristics. RG-213 cable, for example, has less loss at a given frequency compared to RG-58 cable.

## The Best Feed Line for VHF and UHF

The type of feed line that has the lowest loss at VHF and UHF is air-insulated hardline. This type of feed line is particularly effective for these frequencies, helping to ensure clear and powerful signal transmission.
