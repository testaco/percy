# Mastering Speech Processors, S Meters, and Sideband Operation

In this section, we'll delve into the fascinating subject of speech processors and S meters, and how they work within transceivers. We'll also explore the specifics of sideband operation near band edges. 

## Understanding the Purpose and Impact of Speech Processors

A **speech processor** is an important feature in a transceiver. Its main function is to increase the apparent loudness of transmitted voice signals. It achieves this by compressing the dynamic range of the audio signal, which raises the average power of the signal without increasing the peak power. This results in a signal that sounds louder to the listener.

However, the use of a speech processor must be carefully managed. An incorrectly adjusted speech processor can lead to distorted speech and other unwanted effects such as excess intermodulation products and excessive background noise. Thus, understanding how to properly adjust speech processor settings is crucial to maintaining high-quality voice transmissions.

## Deciphering S Meters and Signal Strength

An **S meter** (Signal Strength Meter) is a key tool that measures the strength of received signals in a receiver. It provides a measure of how well a signal is being received, which is critical for effective communication. 

The S meter reading is typically divided into S units, where each S unit represents a change in signal strength. Generally, one S unit corresponds to a 6 dB change in signal strength. 

When comparing signals, a signal that reads 20 dB over S9 is 100 times more powerful than one that reads S9, assuming a properly calibrated S meter. To raise the S meter reading on a distant receiver from S8 to S9, the power output of a transmitter must be raised approximately four times.

## Navigating Sideband Operation Near Band Edges

When operating in sideband modes, it's crucial to understand how the transmitted signal occupies a specific frequency range. For example, a 3 kHz Lower SideBand (LSB) signal when the displayed carrier frequency is set to 7.178 MHz will occupy the frequency range from 7.175 MHz to 7.178 MHz. This is because in LSB operation, the transmitted signal extends below the carrier frequency.

In contrast, a 3 kHz Upper SideBand (USB) signal with the displayed carrier frequency set to 14.347 MHz will occupy the frequency range from 14.347 MHz to 14.350 MHz, as the transmitted signal extends above the carrier frequency in USB operation.

It's also important to consider the boundaries of the band's phone segment when operating in sideband modes. When using a 3 kHz wide LSB, your displayed carrier frequency should be at least 3 kHz above the lower edge of the segment. On the other hand, when using a 3 kHz wide USB, your displayed carrier frequency should be at least 3 kHz below the upper edge of the segment. Following these guidelines will ensure that your transmissions stay within the allocated band and do not interfere with other users.
