# Exploring Wave Propagation in Amateur Radio

Amateur radio operators are faced with several ways that radio waves can propagate, each with its unique characteristics. In this section, we'll delve into the fascinating world of **transequatorial propagation**, **long-path propagation**, **ordinary** and **extraordinary waves**, **chordal hop**, **sporadic-E mechanisms**, and **ground-wave propagation**. By understanding these different propagation methods, you can maximize your amateur radio experience.

## Transequatorial Propagation

Let's start with **transequatorial propagation (TEP)**. This type of propagation is most likely to occur between points that are separated by 2,000 to 3,000 miles over a path perpendicular to the geomagnetic equator. This propagation can cover a maximum range of approximately 5,000 miles, making it an interesting and useful propagation method for amateur radio operators.

Timing plays a significant role in transequatorial propagation. It is most likely to occur in the afternoon or early evening. The specific timing may vary based on geographical location and the time of the year.

## Extraordinary and Ordinary Waves

Next, let's discuss **extraordinary** and **ordinary waves**. These are independently propagating, elliptically polarized waves created in the ionosphere. They have different propagation characteristics that can affect the signal received by an antenna. 

## Long-path Propagation

Now, let's look at **long-path propagation**. This type of propagation is most frequently observed on the 40 meters and 20 meters amateur bands. It involves the radio wave traveling a path longer than half the circumference of the Earth to reach its target. This is different from short-path propagation where the radio wave takes the shortest route possible. 

When you lower a signalâ€™s transmitted elevation angle, the distance covered by each hop increases in ionospheric HF skip propagation. This can be useful for trying to reach distant stations.

## Ground-Wave Propagation

**Ground-wave propagation** is another form of radio wave transmission. This type of propagation uses the ground as a medium to travel. How far these waves can travel is influenced by the signal frequency. As the signal frequency increases, the maximum range of ground-wave propagation decreases. 

Ground-wave propagation supports vertical polarization. This means that the electric field of the wave is perpendicular to the Earth's surface, and it can have an effect on the performance of your antenna.

## Chordal Hop and Sporadic-E Propagation

Let's now turn our attention to the **chordal hop** and **sporadic-E propagation**. Chordal hop is a propagation method characterized by successive ionospheric refractions without an intermediate reflection from the ground. This results in the signal experiencing less loss compared to multi-hop propagation, which uses Earth as a reflector.

Sporadic-E propagation, on the other hand, is a unique form of propagation that is most likely to occur around the solstices, especially the summer solstice. This type of propagation is also most likely to happen between sunrise and sunset. Sporadic-E propagation can result in some interesting and unexpected contact with distant stations even on higher frequency bands.
