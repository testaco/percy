# Amateur Radio in Outer Space: Satellites, Operations, and More

Amateur radio doesn't just exist here on Earth, it also thrives out in space! The use of amateur radio satellites has expanded the reach of the hobby, creating new opportunities for communication and exploration. In this chapter, we'll delve into the fascinating world of amateur satellites, discussing everything from orbital mechanics to specific frequencies and modes, and even the hardware onboard these celestial transmitters.

## Understanding the Course of Amateur Satellites

Amateur satellites, like any other satellites, follow a particular path or **orbit** around the Earth. One term you might come across is an "ascending pass". This term refers to the direction a satellite takes as it orbits the Earth. Specifically, an ascending pass is the part of the satellite's orbit where it moves from south to north. 

## Inside the Linear Transponder

A crucial piece of equipment on many amateur satellites is the **linear transponder**. This device receives, transposes, and retransmits a signal. It's described as "inverting" because the uplink (the signal sent to the satellite) and the downlink (the signal sent from the satellite) are mirror images of each other in the band. Also, an upper sideband on the uplink becomes a lower sideband on the downlink and vice versa. 

## Satellite Modes

When we talk about the "mode" of an amateur radio satellite, we're referring to the satellite's uplink and downlink frequency bands. This mode is often denoted by letters. For example, a satellite in "Mode B" operates with a VHF uplink and a UHF downlink. The letters in a satellite's mode designator specify the uplink and downlink frequency ranges.

## Keplerian Elements and Satellite Orbits

To predict the position of a satellite at any given time, we use parameters known as **Keplerian elements**. These elements define the orbit of a satellite, including its size, shape, and orientation relative to Earth, among other things. Having these elements on hand is essential for tracking a satellite and correctly aligning your antenna for communication.

## The Versatility of Linear Transponders

Linear transponders are capable of relaying a wide variety of signals, including FM, CW, SSB, SSTV, PSK, and packet. However, it's essential to limit the effective radiated power (ERP) to a satellite using a linear transponder to avoid reducing the downlink power for all other users.

## Frequencies and Bands

L band and S band are terms specifying certain frequency ranges. Specifically, the L band refers to frequencies in the 1 to 2 GHz range (23 cm band), and the S band refers to frequencies in the 2 to 4 GHz range (13 cm band).

## Types of Satellites 

Amateur radio satellites come in various types, defined by their orbits. A **geostationary** satellite, for instance, appears to stay in one position in the sky from an observer's perspective on Earth. This stationary position is due to its orbit aligning with the Earth's rotation.

## Antennas and Polarization 

Antenna choice can significantly impact your ability to communicate with satellites. To minimize the effects of spin modulation and Faraday rotation, you can use a circularly polarized antenna. This type of antenna receives all polarizations simultaneously, making it an excellent choice for satellite work.

## Digital Store-and-Forward Functions

Some amateur radio satellites come equipped with digital store-and-forward functions. This feature allows the satellite to hold digital messages in its memory for later download. It's like a celestial mailbox, allowing messages to be sent and received even when the satellite and the ground station can't communicate directly.
