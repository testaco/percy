# Mastering Antenna Types and Their Characteristics

Amateur radio offers a wide array of antennas to suit different needs and applications. In this section, we'll delve into the workings of two popular antenna types: the **Yagi antenna** and the **parabolic reflector antenna**. We'll also explore the concept of **feed point impedance** and **loading of electrically short antennas**, the **antenna Q** (Quality factor), and **RF grounding**. 

## The Power of the Parabolic Reflector Antenna

A **parabolic reflector antenna** is a high-gain type of antenna that uses a parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The reflector shapes an incoming plane wave traveling along the axis into a wave focused at the focal point, or transforms an outgoing wave from a source at the focal point into a plane wave.

One fascinating characteristic of a parabolic reflector antenna is its frequency-dependent gain. As the operating frequency doubles, the gain of an ideal parabolic reflector antenna increases. This is because the antenna's gain is directly proportional to the square of its diameter and the square of the frequency.

## Yagi Antennas: A Closer Look

A **Yagi antenna** is a directional antenna consisting of a dipole (the driven element) and additional passive elements. The most common form is the Yagi-Uda antenna, which includes a reflector and one or more directors, or parasitic elements.

The length of a Yagi's driven element is crucial. It's typically about half a wavelength, and this length helps the antenna to resonate at the desired frequency.

A Yagi antenna can even produce circular polarization if you arrange two of them perpendicularly on the same axis, with their driven elements at the same point on the boom, and feed them 90 degrees out of phase.

Another interesting aspect is the use of parasitic elements. Most two-element Yagis with normal spacing have a reflector instead of a director. Adjusting these elements' lengths either longer or shorter than resonance helps control the antenna's phase shift.

## Electrically Short Antennas and Loading Coils

An **electrically short antenna** is one where the physical length of the antenna is shorter than the wavelength of the frequency it is intended to radiate. For such antennas, a **loading coil** can make all the difference.

A loading coil is used to resonate the antenna by cancelling out the capacitive reactance. This coil is most efficiently located at a voltage maximum point on the antenna. The use of one or more loading coils to resonate an electrically short antenna typically decreases the SWR (standing wave ratio) bandwidth.

The efficiency of a loading coil is largely determined by its ratio of reactance to resistance. The higher this ratio, the more efficient the coil. This is because a high reactance-to-resistance ratio helps maximize the antenna's efficiency.

Top loading is often used in electrically short HF vertical antennas, as it can increase the antenna's radiation efficiency. This is because top loading effectively increases the electrical length of the antenna without significantly increasing the physical height.

As the **Quality factor (Q)** of an antenna increases, the SWR bandwidth decreases. This is because a high-Q antenna is highly resonant at a specific frequency and has a narrow bandwidth.

## The Role of Radiation Resistance and RF Grounding

**Radiation resistance** is a concept that comes into play when dealing with antennas. It is a fictitious resistance that represents the power radiated into space by the antenna. For a base-fed whip antenna, the radiation resistance changes as the frequency varies below its resonant frequency, generally decreasing.

**RF grounding** is another important aspect of antenna setup. It helps to mitigate safety hazards and can improve the performance of some types of antennas.
