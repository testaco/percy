# Understanding Ohm's Law and Circuit Configurations

In this section, we'll delve into the fundamental principles of Ohm's Law and how it applies to different configurations of circuits.

## Ohm's Law Basics

Ohm's law, named after its founder, German physicist Georg Simon Ohm, is one of the most basic, yet most important laws in electronics and electrical engineering. It provides a mathematical relationship between **current (I)**, **voltage (E)**, and **resistance (R)** in an electrical circuit.

The law can be stated as follows:

1. **Current** is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance, or **I = E / R**. This tells us how much electric charge is flowing in the circuit. Current is measured in amperes, also known as amps.

2. **Voltage** is equal to the current multiplied by the resistance, or **E = I * R**. Voltage, also known as electromotive force, is the force that pushes the current through the circuit. It is measured in volts.

3. **Resistance** is equal to the voltage divided by the current, or **R = E / I**. Resistance measures how much a material or component resists the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms.

These formulas can be rearranged in several ways, depending on whether you're trying to solve for current, voltage, or resistance. This makes Ohm's law a powerful tool for analyzing electrical circuits.

## Applying Ohm's Law

Let's look at a few examples:

- If you have a circuit where a current of 3 amperes flows when connected to 90 volts, the resistance of that circuit would be calculated as R = E / I = 90 volts / 3 amperes = 30 ohms.
- If the applied voltage in a circuit is 12 volts and the current flow is 1.5 amperes, the resistance would be R = E / I = 12 volts / 1.5 amperes = 8 ohms.
- If a circuit draws 4 amperes from a 12-volt source, the resistance would be R = E / I = 12 volts / 4 amperes = 3 ohms.

In the same way, you can calculate the current in a circuit if you know the voltage and resistance:

- For a circuit with an applied voltage of 120 volts and a resistance of 80 ohms, the current would be I = E / R = 120 volts / 80 ohms = 1.5 amperes.

And you can calculate the voltage in a circuit if you know the current and resistance:

- If a current of 0.5 amperes flows through a 2-ohm resistor, the voltage across the resistor would be E = I * R = 0.5 amperes * 2 ohms = 1 volt.

## Circuit Configurations: Series and Parallel

Understanding the behavior of current and voltage is especially important when dealing with different circuit configurations, namely series and parallel circuits.

In a **series circuit**, all components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for current. In this type of circuit, the **current is the same through all components**. It's like a single-lane highway where every car (electron) has to follow the same path.

On the other hand, in a **parallel circuit**, all components are connected across each other, forming multiple paths for current. In this type of circuit, the **voltage is the same across all components**. This is more like a multi-lane highway where cars can choose different lanes, but they all start and end at the same points.
