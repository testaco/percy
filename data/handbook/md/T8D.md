# Digital Explorations in Amateur Radio

Amateur radio is not just about voice communications. There are various digital and non-voice modes of communication that allow operators to transmit different types of data. This chapter will explore these modes, focusing on their applications, definitions, and how they function.

## Packet Radio: A Digital Communications Mode

In the world of amateur radio, **packet radio** is a form of digital communication. This mode allows the transfer of data packets over radio links. It is similar to how the internet operates, where data is broken into packets and sent to a destination where they are reassembled. It's not uncommon for packet radio transmissions to include a check sum for error detection, a header containing the call sign of the station to which the information is being sent, and an automatic repeat request in case of error.

## DMR and Talkgroups

**Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)** is another popular digital communication mode. It's a technique for time-multiplexing two digital voice signals on a single 12.5 kHz repeater channel. This technology is employed in many commercial and amateur radio systems. A unique aspect of DMR is the concept of a **talkgroup**. This is a way for groups of users to share a channel at different times without hearing other users on the channel. Essentially, it allows for specific group conversations within a radio network.

## APRS: More Than Just Position Data

**Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)** is a digital communication mode that is widely used in amateur radio. It allows for the transmission of various types of data such as GPS position data, text messages, and weather data. APRS is often used for real-time tactical digital communications in conjunction with a map showing the locations of stations. This can be particularly useful in emergency situations or event coordination where the positions of various stations need to be tracked.

## NTSC: Analog TV Signal

**NTSC**, which stands for National Television System Committee, is a term used to describe an analog fast-scan color TV signal. Despite the digital revolution, this mode is still used in some amateur radio applications, particularly in the field of Amateur Television (ATV).

## PSK: A Keying Technique

**Phase Shift Keying (PSK)** is a digital modulation scheme that conveys data by changing the phase of a reference signal. It's a popular method for digital data transmission as it provides high data rates with relatively low power usage and equipment complexity.

## WSJT-X: A Digital Mode Software Suite

The **WSJT-X software suite** is a popular tool for digital mode operations in amateur radio. It provides support for various operating activities such as Earth-Moon-Earth communication, weak signal propagation beacons, and meteor scatter. 

## ARQ: An Error Correction Technique

In digital communications, **ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest)** is a transmission system that includes an error correction method. If the receiving station detects errors, it sends a request for retransmission. This system ensures the integrity of data being received, which is critical in many amateur radio applications.

## Amateur Radio Mesh Networks

An **amateur radio mesh network** is a data network that uses commercial Wi-Fi equipment with modified firmware. These networks allow amateur radio operators to create their own decentralized network infrastructure, independent from the internet. This can be especially useful in emergency situations where traditional communication networks may be compromised.

## FT8: A Low Signal-to-Noise Digital Mode

In the realm of digital modes, **FT8** is a mode capable of operating with low signal-to-noise ratios. This makes it a popular choice for weak signal communication, such as when trying to make contact over long distances or through challenging propagation conditions.
