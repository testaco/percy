# Mastering Components of Electronic Circuits

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental components used in electronic circuits: resistors, capacitors, inductors, rectifiers, solid-state diodes and transistors, vacuum tubes, and batteries. Understanding how these components behave and interact is key to building and troubleshooting electronic circuits, and will provide a solid foundation for your journey in amateur radio.

## Batteries and Their Properties

Batteries are a crucial part of any portable electronic device. In terms of amateur radio, they can power handheld transceivers, portable antennas, and other field equipment. The **standard 12-volt lead-acid battery** is a common type of battery used in many applications. To ensure the longest possible life for such a battery, it's important not to discharge it below a certain voltage. 

Another crucial property of batteries is their **internal resistance**. Batteries with low internal resistance are desirable because they can provide a high discharge current. This means they can supply a lot of power quickly, which can be useful in situations where a large amount of energy is needed in a short time.

## Diodes and Their Characteristics

Diodes are electronic components that allow current to flow in one direction but not the other. They play a key role in many electronic devices, including radios. Diodes come in various types, including germanium and silicon diodes. Each type of diode has a characteristic **forward threshold voltage**, which is the minimum voltage needed for the diode to conduct current in the forward direction.

## Capacitors and Their Properties

Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field and are a crucial component in many electronic circuits. Two types of capacitors you might encounter are the **electrolytic capacitor** and the **low voltage ceramic capacitor**. Electrolytic capacitors are known for their high capacitance for a given volume, while low voltage ceramic capacitors are comparatively low cost.

## Resistors in RF Circuits

Resistors are used to control the flow of electrical current in a circuit. While they are a common and indispensable element in electronics, **wire-wound resistors** are not suitable for use in RF circuits. The reason for this is their inherent inductance, which can make the performance of the circuit unpredictable at radio frequencies.

## Transistors and Their Operating Points

Transistors are semiconductor devices that can amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. When a **bipolar transistor** is used as a switch, its operating points are the saturation and cutoff states. In the saturation state, the transistor allows maximum current to flow, while in the cutoff state, it allows no current to flow.

## MOSFET Construction

MOSFET stands for Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor. In a **MOSFET**, the gate, which controls the flow of current, is separated from the channel (where the current flows) by a thin insulating layer. This insulated gate is one of the key features that distinguish MOSFETs from other types of transistors.

## Vacuum Tubes

Vacuum tubes are electronic devices used to amplify, switch, modify, or create signals. The **control grid** in a vacuum tube regulates the flow of electrons between the cathode and plate, allowing the tube to amplify or switch signals as needed. Another important element in a vacuum tube is the **screen grid**, whose primary purpose is to reduce grid-to-plate capacitance, making the tube more efficient.

## Inductor's Self-Resonant Frequency

An **inductor** is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. When an inductor is operated above its self-resonant frequency, it becomes capacitive, meaning it starts to behave more like a capacitor than an inductor. This change can significantly affect the performance of the circuit in which the inductor is used.
