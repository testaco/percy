# Journey of Radio Waves: Characteristics and Influences

Amateur radio is a fascinating journey where invisible waves travel across the world, sometimes even beyond it. To truly appreciate this journey, we must understand the characteristics of these waves, the factors that influence their propagation, and how to optimize our equipment settings for effective communication.

## Understanding Radio Wave Propagation

When we talk on our radios, we're not just sending sounds into the ether. We're sending radio waves, and these waves don't always travel in a straight line. For VHF (Very High Frequency) signals, moving the antenna just a few feet can greatly affect the signal strength. This is due to a phenomenon called **multipath propagation**, where signals bounce off buildings, mountains, and other objects, creating multiple paths from the transmitter to the receiver. These multiple signals can cancel each other out or reinforce each other, causing the signal strength to vary.

At times, you might come across a term "picket fencing," which is often used to describe the rapid fluttering or fading of mobile signals. This, too, is a result of multipath propagation—the signal is bouncing off various obstacles as you move, causing the signal strength to fluctuate rapidly.

Multipath propagation can also significantly affect data transmissions. When signals take multiple paths to reach the receiver, they can arrive at slightly different times. This can cause errors in the data received, increasing the error rates. 

## Influence of Environment on Radio Waves

The environment can greatly affect how radio waves propagate. For instance, vegetation, particularly trees and shrubs, can absorb UHF (Ultra High Frequency) and microwave signals, reducing their strength. Likewise, weather conditions can also impact signal propagation. Rain and fog, for instance, can absorb signals in the 10 meter and 6 meter bands, reducing their range. Similarly, at microwave frequencies, precipitation can significantly decrease the range of communication.

Even the atmosphere plays a role in how radio waves travel. The section of the atmosphere known as the **ionosphere** can refract or bend HF (High Frequency) and VHF radio waves, allowing them to travel beyond the horizon. However, signals propagated by the ionosphere are elliptically polarized, meaning they oscillate in an elliptical path. This has an interesting consequence: regardless of whether your antenna is vertically or horizontally polarized, it can transmit and receive these signals.

However, the ionosphere can also cause irregular fading of signals. This is due to signals combining randomly as they arrive via different paths through the ionosphere.

## Polarization and Antenna Orientation

The orientation of your antenna can greatly influence the strength of the signals you receive. This is because radio waves can be **polarized**—they can oscillate vertically, horizontally, or in a circular or elliptical path.

For long-distance CW (Continuous Wave) and SSB (Single Sideband) contacts on the VHF and UHF bands, horizontal polarization is normally used. This is because horizontally polarized waves are less likely to be absorbed by the ground and more likely to be reflected by the ionosphere.

However, if the antennas at opposite ends of a VHF or UHF line of sight radio link are not using the same polarization, the received signal strength is reduced. This is because the antenna is not aligned with the direction of the wave's oscillation, reducing its ability to pick up the signal.

When obstructions are blocking the direct line of sight to a distant repeater, you might be able to establish communication by finding a path that reflects signals to the repeater. This is another example of multipath propagation—instead of being a problem, it can be used to your advantage. 

Thus, understanding the characteristics of radio waves and the factors that influence their propagation can help you optimize your antenna settings and improve your communication range and quality. This knowledge is not just about passing an exam—it's about becoming a skilled and effective amateur radio operator.
