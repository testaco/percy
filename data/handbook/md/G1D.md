# The Role and Responsibilities of Volunteer Examiners and License Operations

This section delves into the fundamental understanding of the roles and responsibilities of **Volunteer Examiners (VEs)** and **Volunteer Examiner Coordinators (VECs)**. Additionally, we will explore the concept of remote operation and its licensing requirements, temporary identification, and the nature of element credit.

## The Volunteer Examiner System

The **Volunteer Examiner System** plays a vital role in the amateur radio community. It is through this system that new aspirants are tested and existing licensees upgrade their licenses. The system is overseen by the **Volunteer Examiner Coordinators (VECs)**, who are tasked with accrediting Volunteer Examiners.

**Volunteer Examiners (VEs)** are experienced amateur radio operators who administer the FCC's amateur radio license examinations. To qualify as a VE, an individual must hold a General class license or higher. The role of a VE is not restricted by nationality. Non-US citizens can also become VEs, provided they hold an FCC-granted amateur radio license of General class or above.

The examination process for a Technician class license requires the presence of at least three VEs of General class or higher. This ensures the integrity of the examination and adherence to FCC regulations.

## Partial Credit and Element Credit

In amateur radio licensing, there is a provision for partial credit for expired licenses. This allows individuals who once held an FCC-issued General, Advanced, or Amateur Extra class license to receive credit for the elements represented by the expired license, even if the license was not revoked by the FCC.

A **Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE)** is another form of element credit. It's a document issued by a VE team to an examinee who has successfully passed one or more of the amateur radio license examination elements. This certificate is valid for 365 days from the issue date.

## Temporary Identification and Upgrade Process

When a Technician licensee has successfully passed their General class examination and received a CSCE, they can operate using General class frequency privileges. However, until the upgrade is shown in the FCC database, the licensee must identify with "AG" after their call sign whenever they operate using General class frequency privileges. This ensures clarity and compliance with FCC regulations.

If a previously held license has expired and the two-year grace period has passed, obtaining a new General class license requires showing proof of the appropriate expired license grant and passing the current Element 2 exam.

## Remote Operation and Licensing

The advent of the internet has enabled a new way to operate amateur radio, known as remote operation. This is when a station is operated remotely, possibly even from outside the country where the station is located. 

When operating a remote station from outside the U.S, it's essential to understand the licensing requirements. The control operator must hold a valid U.S operator/primary station license, irrespective of their location. 

When operating a station in a foreign country by remote control over the internet from the U.S, the regulations of both the remote stationâ€™s country and the FCC apply. This is to ensure compliance with both national and international amateur radio regulations.
