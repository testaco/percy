# Dipole and Monopole Antennas: Understanding the Basics

Dipole and monopole antennas are fundamental elements in radio communication. Understanding their properties, including radiation patterns, impedance, and antenna lengths, can significantly improve your ability to set up effective communication systems. This chapter will help you gain a solid foundation in the basics of these antennas.

## A Deep Dive into Dipole and Monopole Antennas

**Dipole antennas** are a type of linear antenna that is made up of two conductive elements such as metal wires or rods. The center of the antenna is usually connected to a radio frequency (RF) transmitter or receiver. These antennas are commonly used in various types of radio systems due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

**Monopole antennas**, on the other hand, are a type of antenna that consists of a single straight rod or wire that is usually mounted over some type of ground plane. The base of the antenna is at or near ground potential and the top is at a high potential.

### Characteristics of Random-Wire HF Antennas

Random-wire antennas are a type of HF (High Frequency) antenna that are directly connected to the transmitter. An important characteristic of these antennas is that the station equipment may carry significant RF current, which could lead to RF burns if not handled properly. 

### Feed Point Impedance of Monopole Antennas

The feed point impedance of an elevated quarter-wave ground-plane vertical antenna can be adjusted to be approximately 50 ohms by sloping the radials downward. This adjustment is crucial for matching the impedance of the antenna to the transmitter, which helps to maximize power transfer.

### Radiation Patterns of Dipole and Monopole Antennas

The radiation pattern of a quarter-wave ground-plane vertical antenna is omnidirectional in azimuth, which means it radiates equally well in all horizontal directions. This is ideal for applications where the direction of the incoming signal is not known, such as in broadcasting and mobile communications.

The radiation pattern of a dipole antenna in free space in a plane containing the conductor is a figure-eight at right angles to the antenna. This means that the antenna radiates power in two opposite directions, making it useful for point-to-point communications.

### Antenna Height and its Effects

The height of a horizontal dipole HF antenna can significantly affect its azimuthal radiation pattern, particularly at elevation angles higher than about 45 degrees. If the antenna is less than 1/2 wavelength high, the azimuthal pattern is almost omnidirectional, meaning it transmits and receives signals equally well in all horizontal directions.

### Placement of Radial Wires for Vertical Antennas

The radial wires of a ground-mounted vertical antenna system should be placed on the surface or buried a few inches below the ground. This helps to provide a good ground connection for the antenna, which is crucial for its performance.

### Impedance Changes with Height and Feed Point Location

The feed point impedance of a horizontal 1/2 wave dipole antenna changes as the antenna height is reduced to 1/10 wavelength above ground. Specifically, the impedance steadily increases as the height decreases.

Similarly, the feed point impedance of a 1/2 wave dipole also changes as the feed point is moved from the center toward the ends. It steadily increases as the feed point moves towards the ends.

### Advantages of Horizontal Polarization

Using a horizontally polarized antenna for HF communication has certain advantages over vertically polarized antennas. One such advantage is lower ground losses, which leads to more efficient transmission and reception of signals.

### Determining Antenna Lengths

When designing a 1/2 wave dipole antenna, it's important to cut it to the right length for the frequency you intend to use. For instance, a 1/2 wave dipole antenna cut for 14.250 MHz should be approximately 33 feet long.

Similarly, for a 1/4 wave monopole antenna cut for 28.5 MHz, the length should be approximately 8 feet. This length ensures that the antenna resonates at the desired frequency, which helps to maximize the efficiency of the antenna.
