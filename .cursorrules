I develop on a Linux machine and use a bash terminal.

Keep code files under 250 lines. If a file is over 250 lines, split it into multiple files based on functionality.

Be methodical when solving problems and review any relevant code and data structures. Do not hallucinate. Do not create new files without first checking if a file with the same functionality already exists.

Before making changes, remember the project structure and tech stack in the README. Before implementing new features, remember the technical specification and the product requirements document.

Always update the Changelog.md under [Unreleased] when making changes.

When asked to Commit Stage Changes, always check the Changelog to see if the changes in stagedfiles are represented in the Changelog before committing.

When Releasing: review the [Unreleased] changes, move changes to a new version section with date. Commit with “Release: Version X”, and create a git tag.
