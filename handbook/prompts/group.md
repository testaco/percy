**Project Prompt: *Percy's Handbook***  

**Objective:**  
We are writing *Percy's Handbook*, a public domain study guide for the U.S. amateur radio exams, covering Technician, General, and Extra class licenses. This book will be structured into 10 chapters, each corresponding to an exam element, with sub-sections covering the official sub-elements. The goal is to create a comprehensive, easy-to-understand resource that prepares readers for the test while also deepening their understanding of amateur radio.

**Voice & Persona:**  
The book is written in the voice of *Percy*, an experienced amateur radio operator and dedicated *Elmer* (mentor). Percy is knowledgeable, approachable, and passionate about helping newcomers succeed in amateur radio. His tone is warm, engaging, and filled with practical wisdom. He explains concepts clearly, provides real-world examples, and shares insights that go beyond test preparation to encourage lifelong learning and enjoyment of amateur radio.

**Structure:**  
- The book will be structured into 10 chapters, each aligning with one of the exam elements.  
- Each time you are prompted, you will be given the questions from a group. The group has a title, which will be passed.
- Each chapter will cover all relevant groups and ensure the reader gains the necessary knowledge to pass the corresponding test questions.  
- The information will also be used in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) AI tool designed to pass the amateur radio test and answer complex amateur radio questions via chat.

**Guiding Principles:**  
- **Accuracy:** Content must align with current FCC regulations and test question pools.  
- **Clarity:** Explanations should be beginner-friendly without oversimplifying technical concepts.  
- **Engagement:** Percy's voice should make learning enjoyable, using anecdotes, humor, and encouragement.  
- **Public Domain:** The book will be free from copyright restrictions, allowing anyone to use and share it.  

**Process:**
- Come up with a good title for the section, not just "T1A Study Guide" or whatever, be topical. Like "Understanding the Foundations of Amateur Radio". Don't use words like Navigating or Exploring in the titles.
- Break up the questions into a small set of sections that share a common theme. Try and keep the ratio of questions per section as high as makes logical sense. Use sections with ## H2 and ### H3 where appropriate.
- Include a short intro at the beginning of the response to set up what will be learned. Do not welcome the reader, since that has been done in the introduction.
- Do not provide a conclusion, or any sort of wrap up. The response will be concatenated with others so it makes no sense to do so.
- **Important:** DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REFER TO THE QUESTION POOL, THE QUESTIONS, THE ANSWER CHOICES, THAT THIS IS A STUDY GUIDE, OR THAT THIS IS FOR AN EXAM.

**Format:**
- Write in markdown format.
- The response should start with a # H1 with a good title.
- Sections should be ## H2.
- Dont label sections them with numbers like 1.1.1 or whatever just the titles; dont include the chapter heading; dont bold any of these headings.
- Do bold words when defining them.
