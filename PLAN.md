# Research Plan: Improving Small LLM Performance on Amateur Radio Exams

## Objectives
1. Enhance small, locally-runnable LLMs' performance on amateur radio exams through:
   - Chain of thought (CoT) reasoning
   - RAG-based context enhancement
   - Systematic evaluation of different configurations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Chain of Thought Integration
1. Modify `evaluate_test.py` to add CoT capability:
   - Add `--cot` flag to enable chain of thought mode
   - Create new prompt template encouraging step-by-step reasoning
   - Update response parsing to extract final answer from last character
   - Preserve full reasoning chain in results for analysis

### Phase 2: RAG Pipeline Implementation
1. Create new module `handbook_indexer.py`:
   - Build vector store from handbook content
   - Implement similarity search functionality
   - Add caching to prevent redundant processing

2. Modify `evaluate_test.py` to add RAG capability:
   - Add `--rag` flag to enable RAG enhancement
   - Implement context retrieval from handbook
   - Create enhanced prompt template incorporating retrieved context
   - Store retrieved contexts in results for analysis

### Phase 3: Evaluation Framework
1. Create new script `batch_evaluate.py`:
   - Support running multiple models with different configurations
   - Parameter grid:
     * Model size/type
     * CoT (on/off)
     * RAG (on/off)
     * Temperature settings
     * Context window sizes
   - Save comprehensive results for analysis

2. Enhance `analyze_results.py`:
   - Add statistical analysis capabilities
   - Generate visualization suite:
     * Score comparison across configurations
     * Performance vs model size
     * Impact of CoT and RAG
     * Error pattern analysis
   - Export results in publication-ready format

## Success Metrics
1. Primary Goal:
   - Achieve 74% pass rate with smaller, locally-runnable models

2. Analysis Metrics:
   - Score improvement from baseline
   - Impact of each enhancement (CoT, RAG)
   - Resource usage (memory, processing time)
   - Cost-benefit analysis of different configurations

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
2. Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
3. Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
4. Analysis and Documentation: 1-2 weeks

## Technical Requirements
1. New Dependencies:
   - Vector store (FAISS or Chroma)
   - Plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn)
   - Statistical analysis tools (pandas, scipy)

2. Infrastructure:
   - Local GPU for model running
   - Storage for vector indices
   - Results database/storage

## Expected Outcomes
1. Technical:
   - Optimized prompt engineering patterns
   - Effective RAG pipeline for domain-specific knowledge
   - Quantitative analysis of enhancement impacts

2. Research:
   - Understanding of size vs capability trade-offs
   - Documentation of effective techniques for small model enhancement
   - Potential publication/sharing of findings

## Future Extensions
1. Potential improvements:
   - Multi-hop reasoning chains
   - Hybrid approaches combining multiple small models
   - Dynamic context selection
   - Fine-tuning on handbook content

2. Applications:
   - Extension to other technical certification domains
   - Development of lightweight study tools
   - Creation of automated tutoring systems
